The "4 principles of simple design"
-----------------------------------

This short series of principles is easy to remember, but surprisingly deep.

A design is simple to the extent that it:

- Passes its tests
- Minimizes duplication
- Maximizes clarity (reveals its intent)
- Has fewer elements (classes/modules/packages...)

SOLID & GRASP
-------------

A solid grasp (or "SOLID GRASP", see below) of object-oriented techniques is expected to work on the Abilian project.

SOLID means:

- `Single responsibility principle <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle>`_: a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).

- Open/closed principle: software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- Liskov substitution principle: "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."

- Interface segregation principle: many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

- Dependency inversion principle: one should “Depend on Abstractions. Do not depend on concretions."



Here are a few references:

- `SOLID <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)>`_ and `GRASP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)>`_ (according to Wikipedia)

Domain Driven Design
--------------------

Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model.[1] The premise of domain-driven design is the following:

- Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic.
- Basing complex designs on a model of the domain.
- Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.

(Source: `Domain-driven design on Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design>`_).

These are very general (and important) principles, which we will develop in future versions of this guide.

There are also important and useful principles on how to architect and design your application. See below for some patterns.


Tactical patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the list of the technical (or tactical) patterns that are relevant to DDD.

- Layered (or onion, or hexagonal) Architecture: "Isolate the expression of the domain model and the business logic, and eliminate any dependency on infrastructure, user interface, or even application logic that is not business logic."

- Entities: "When an object is distinguished by its identity, rather than its attributes, make this primary to its definition in the model. Keep the class definition simple and focused on life cycle continuity and identity."

- Value Objects: "When you care only about the attributes and logic of an element of the model, classify it as a value object. Make it express the meaning of the attributes it conveys and give it related functionality. Treat the value object as immutable."

- Domain Events: "Model information about activity in the domain as a series of discrete events. Represent each event as a domain object. These are distinct from system events that reflect activity within the software itself."

- Domain Services: "When a significant process or transformation in the domain is not a natural responsibility of an entity or value object, add an operation to the model as a standalone interface declared as a service."

- Modules: "Choose modules that tell the story of the system and contain a cohesive set of concepts. Give the modules names that become part of the ubiquitous language."

- Aggregates: "Cluster the entities and value objects into aggregates and define boundaries around each. Choose one entity to be the root of each aggregate, and allow external objects to hold references to the root only (references to internal members passed out for use within a single operation only)."

- Repositories: "For each type of aggregate that needs global access, create a service that can provide the illusion of an in-memory collection of all objects of that aggregate’s root type."

- Factories: "Shift the responsibility for creating instances of complex objects and aggregates to a separate object, which may itself have no responsibility in the domain model but is still part of the domain design."

Some of these patterns may look a bit scary for a Python developer at first, but they make sense. See `Deliver Domain Driven Design Dynamically <http://goo.gl/BvTcHJ>`_ for a good discussion.

Hexagonal Architecture
----------------------

(Also known as "Ports & Adapters" or "Onion Architecture").

Here's a high-level view of how we should structure our framework:

- <http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html> (+ all the references in the text).
- <http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture>

This architectural principle is compatible with DDD (see: <http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/10/ddd-onion-architecture>).

Test Driven Development
-----------------------

    The best thing about years of TDD practice is that I will *never* commit a test without seeing it fail, whether I write it first or not. -- Gary Bernhardt <https://twitter.com/garybernhardt/status/572856330572075010>

Motivation and principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After seeing Gary Bernhardt video "`Slow test / fast test <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAxiiRPHS9k>`_" (see also `this report <https://pycon-2012-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fast_tests_slow_tests.html>`_ on the same talk), I'm convinced that it's important, and possible to achieve, to have unit tests that pass as fast as possible (< 1 sec!), and possibly slower tests that are not run as often.

Our approach should be to distinguish between different tests classes:

- Unit tests (in tests/unit), that test classes mostly in isolation, using mocks or stubs if needed. These are the most important tests from the software design point of view, and these are tests that should run really fast (a few seconds for a whole test suite).

- Integration tests (in tests/integration), that test integration of actual components (no mocks).

- Functional web tests, that test the web apps using the web interface, either using a browser (Selenium / WebDriver) or that leverage the framework to a similar effect.

- Functional web API tests, that thoroughly test a web API using either an external tool (ex: FunkLoad) or the testing framework provided by Flask.

- Load tests, using something like FunkLoad.

- System tests, that test the full system (in a VM), including upgrade scenarios.

An important source of confusion for Python developers that are not experienced with TDD is that just because you are importing the ``unittest`` module doesn't mean you are doing unit testing (same if you are using, as we do, the ``py.test`` framework). Unit testing means that you are testing units in isolation.

At this point, our functional tests are merged with integration tests, load tests are non-existent. Regarding system tests, the tests that we are running on the Travis CI platform could qualify as systems tests, since we're rebuilding a whole VM each time we're running the test suite on Travis. But we are are not testing upgrade at this point.

We should aim for at least 80% measurable line coverage.


Tools for Test Driven Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We're using py.test as our primary test runner and test framework, as we believe it to me the most "pythonic" of all testing frameworks (much more so that the standard library's ``unittest`` module, which is clearly heavily influenced by Java and indirectly SmallTalk). This was not always the case, so we plan to migrate our tests progressively to fully leverage py.test as a testing framework (and not just a test runner).

- Mocking
- Web testing

API design
----------

As library / frameworks author, we must be extra careful wrt the quality of our API. A good project should have APIs that are stable (so if you make a mistake, you must live with it for a long time), easy to use and remember, etc.

- <http://qt-project.org/wiki/API_Design_Principles>
- <http://lcsd05.cs.tamu.edu/slides/keynote.pdf>
- <http://pyvideo.org/video/1705/api-design-for-library-authors>

This is both true for "regular" API (in whatever language we are working on) and for "Web" API.

For Web API, we're promoting the REST architectural style.
